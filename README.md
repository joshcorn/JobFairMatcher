# JobFairMatcher
A tool for SVA's Products of Design department to match students with companies who come for an annual job fair. Students make their top 15 choices on a Google Form and the output is exported to a CSV file. This tool takes the resultant CSV file and runs through all the choices to output a new CSV with all the matched pairs across multiple sessions.
